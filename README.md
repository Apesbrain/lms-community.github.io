To get a local development environment up you can do the following:

1. Follow the installation instructions on https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/ to make sure that mkdocs-material is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository (or fork this repository).
3. Use `mkdocs serve` to setup a live preview server from the local repository. The server will automatically rebuild the site upon saving.
