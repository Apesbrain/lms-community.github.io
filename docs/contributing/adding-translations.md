# Adding translations

With the help of more than 30 volunteers LMS has already been translated into more than 17 languages!

If you would like to help us to make LMS even more globally accessible and have noticed a missing translation in your language, or would like to add a new language, you can help us by creating a pull request on Github for your changes in the file [strings.txt](https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver/blob/HEAD/strings.txt). This file contains all translations of all text strings which are used in LMS and is pretty self-explanatory.
