# Advanced guide to OpenVPN on SB Touch/Radio

This guide describes the procedure to install OpenVPN on your Squeezebox Touch or Squeezebox Radio. You can use this to connect your Squeezebox player to your remote home network using OpenVPN. This guide assumes you have a functioning OpenVPN setup on your network. Also this guide assumes basic knowledge of \*nix administration (especially for the usage of `vi`).

## Squeezebox Touch

We need the `openvpn` binary and the `tun` kernel module for the SB Touch and your ovpn.config as text.

Download the latest `fab4-openvpn-x.y.z.zip` from [Ralphy's repository](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lmsclients/files/squeezeos/) and copy it into the SB Touch:

```bash
scp -O /path/to/fab4-openvpn-x.y.z.zip root@192.168.1.100:/dev
```

Then we `ssh` into the SB Touch and enter the following commands:

```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.100
cd /dev
unzip fab4-openvpn-2.5.10.zip
mv /dev/openvpn /usr/sbin
chmod 755 /usr/sbin/openvpn
mv /dev/tun.ko /lib/modules/2.6.26.8-rt16-332-g5849bfa
mkdir -p /etc/openvpn
```

Next we create the file with `vi` and there you enter the text of your ovpn.config. Make sure you insert `auth-user-pass /etc/openvpn/up` into the config:
```bash
vi /etc/openvpn/TUN.ovpn
```

Next create the file `up` and enter your vpn username in first line and password in second line:
```bash
vi /etc/openvpn/up
```

Next is the `rcS.local` file which runs the stuff at boot:
```bash
vi /etc/init.d/rcS.local
```

We paste these two commands into that file:
```bash
# Load the tunnel kernel module.
insmod /lib/modules/2.6.26.8-rt16-332-g5849bfa/tun.ko
# Start openvpn
/usr/sbin/openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/TUN.ovpn --daemon
```

Then `chmod` that file:
```bash
chmod 755 /etc/init.d/rcS.local
```

Then we put a script which gets NTP time when network is up. We need this to get the right time to connect to vpn.
```bash
vi /etc/network/if-up.d/settime
```

Put the following contents into that file:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# /etc/network/if-up.d/settime
# Sets the hardware clock from an NTP server on reboot
# Replace this with the address of your local time server
# or with a public NTP server like pool.ntp.org or time.google.com
NTP_SERVER=pool.ntp.org
# Log file with system time before and after synchronisation
LOG_FILE="/var/log/settime.log"
if [ "$METHOD" != "loopback" ]; then
date >> $LOG_FILE
echo "Synchronizing time with $NTP_SERVER via $IFACE" >> $LOG_FILE
msntp -r -P no $NTP_SERVER && hwclock -w -u
date >> $LOG_FILE
fi
```

Then we `chmod` that file:
```
chmod +x /etc/network/if-up.d/settime
```

Thatâ€™s it, we are done, hope it is running fine. We can now reboot:
```
reboot
```

## Squeezebox Radio

For the Radio it is the same, only 2 differences:
```
scp -O /path/to/baby-openvpn-x.y.z.zip root@192.168.1.100:/dev
mv /dev/tun.ko /lib/modules/2.6.26.8-rt16
```

The `rcS.local` should have this line instead:
```
insmod /lib/modules/2.6.26.8-rt16/tun.ko
```
