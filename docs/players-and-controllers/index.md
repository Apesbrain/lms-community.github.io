## Hardware based

Between 2001 and 2010 Logitech (and its predecessor Slim Devices) released a series of network music players. The lineup consisted of the Squeezebox Classic, an all-in-one Squeezebox Boom, the dual unit Squeezebox Duet, the audiophile grade Transporter, the small and optionally battery powered Squeezebox Radio, and the newest of the bunch, the Squeezebox Touch.

Additionally, the Squeezebox Controller provides unparalleled control of all your players via an attractive full color display. The Controller and Receiver are sold together as the Squeezebox Duet package.
