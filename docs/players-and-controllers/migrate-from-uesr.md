# Migrate from UE SmartRadio (UESR)

!!! note
    Please note that SmartRadios transitioned to Squeezebox Radios will require [Logitech Media Server](/getting-started-with-LMS)</a> version 8.3.1 or above.


## Reasons to transition to Squeezebox

* You want to be independent of a cloud service (UESmartRadio.com).

* You want to use and sync your device alongside other Squeezebox devices such as Touch, Boom, Classic or other Squeezebox Radios.

* You want to use the [Logitech Media Server](/reference/logitech-media-server) to play music from attached NAS storage devices or using 3rd party developer plug-ins.
    
* You want to stream music files stored on your PC or Mac to your Radio but do not have a permanent Internet connection available.


## How to proceed

To initiate the transition, navigate to "Advanced Settings" on your Smart Radio and scroll down to select "Switch to Squeezebox".
