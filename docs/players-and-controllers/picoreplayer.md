# piCorePlayer (pCP)

piCorePlayer is a dedicated Linux distribution targeted for the Raspberry Pi hardware. By installing extra software packages and hardware additional features can be added.

piCorePlayer is built on a very small linux distro which is only about 12 MB, known as piCore Linux. It boots very fast and it is running entirely in RAM, it doesn't write to the SD-card unless you want to save a new setting. Therefore, pCP is very robust and you can simply pull the power without any risk of corruption of your SD card.
