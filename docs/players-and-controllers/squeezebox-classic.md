Released at the end of October 2005, this is the 3rd Generation Squeezebox or SB3. It originally had the simple product name of Squeezebox, but has now been rebranded as Squeezebox Classic.

Functionally, it is the same as the Squeezebox2, however a new case designed by Fred Bould and crisper display make it a fine addition to one's home.

Note: The 3rd Generation Squeezebox is identified as Squeezebox2 in `Settings->Player Information->Player Model`.
