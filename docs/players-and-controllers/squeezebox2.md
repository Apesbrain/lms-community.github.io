Squeezebox2, released in 2005, is the third generation network media player, produced by Slim Devices. The Squeezebox2 did not change physically from the original Squeezebox; all of the changes were under the hood. The Squeezebox2 added support for 802.11g and WPA Personal encryption as well as native FLAC support in addition to MP3, WMA, AAC, WAV, OggVorbis and Shoutcast.

It supports Unicode fonts and Automatic Volume Adjustment.
