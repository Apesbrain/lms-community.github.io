# Squeezelite

Squeezelite is one of several software clients available for Lyrion Music Server. Squeezelite does not have any user interface of its own and must be controlled via Lyrion Music Server's web interface or another Lyrion Music Server client. 

## Features

Squeezelite supports gapless playback, a wide range of sample rates (44.1 kHz / 48 kHz / 88.2 kHz / 96 kHz / 176.4 kHz / 192 kHz / 352.8 kHz / 384 kHz) and direct streaming for Lyrion Music Server plugins that require it such as Spotify. It is capable of utilizing Lyrion Music Server's client synchronization feature which allows grouping clients for simultaneous, synchronized music playback. Squeezelite uses ALSA for audio output on Linux and PortAudio for other platforms.
