# SSH Access to SB Radio/Touch/Controller and UE Smart Radio

SSH access is only available on devices running the SqueezeOS platform. This is not the case for Squeezebox Classic/Boom/Transporter/Receiver.

## Squeezebox Radio / Touch / Controller

On the Squeezeboxen SSH can be enabled in Settings/Advanced Settings/Remote Access. Follow the instructions on screen.

## UE Smart Radio

On the UE Smart Radio enabling SSH is a little more complicated. Many of those useful developers features have been hidden in a Developers menu:

* Go to the "Settings" menu

* Press both the "Home" and the ">>" (forward) button simultaneously.

* Now there should be an additional "Developer" menu at the bottom of the "Settings" menu.

* In the Developer menu, go to "Remote Access".

* Follow the instructions on screen.
